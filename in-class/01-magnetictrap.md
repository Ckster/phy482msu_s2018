title: Building a Magnetic Trap
---

![magtrap][magtrap]

You and your team have been hired by a condensed matter research group to work on the development of a magnetic trap for Rubidium atoms. Your first task is to make a rough design for the trap including its dimensions, necessary currents and fields, and the rationale for the design. You may make the necessary assumptions to cast the design as a classical electromagnetic problem, but you will need to explain these assumptions. Graphs and plots are appreciated if they better illustrate your design.
