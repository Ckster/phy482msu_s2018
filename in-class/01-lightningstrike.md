title: Lightning Strike at SLAC
---

![SLAC][slac-aerial]

You and your team have been hired by Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. They are making upgrades to the accelerator, which require them to expose the metal pipe that contains the beam to the elements. One afternoon while the initial dig is occuring, a lightning bolt strikes the 2 mile long pipe. Make an assessment of the implications for the electronic equipment inside and outside the pipe. Your assessment should include clear rationale for why it is being made, estimates for any relevant quantities, as well as plots and/or graphs of relevant information.

A line engineer notices a small hole in the pipe. How does this affect your assessment? Again, make concrete estimates where possible.
